there are 3 subquestion:
  |'time window' | 'install time'|
--|--------------|---------------|---------
1.|    0         |    const      |
2.|    1         |    const      |
3.|    1         |    variable   | and others
                                       ^
                                     自由发挥

#focus on solving problem #1
1.the shortest distance between two nodes:Dijkstra, OK
2.one car traverse from origin, and back to origin <next goal>
	Travelling Salesman Problem
	my algo: BFS or DFS from O to O, and cut branches(consider time efficiency)
3.divide nodes to 14 parts for 14 cars, consider: <--main algorithm
-->path length(means time)
-->node number(considering install time)
the time of the 14 parts should be similar -> less time

#a little think about problem #2
every car:
	time to departure
	time of return 
divide to 14 parts <WITH TIME>
